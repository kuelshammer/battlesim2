Goblin Ambush (Level 1, simple)\n2. Orc Raid (Level 3, mixed melee/ranged)\n3.

Every run produces slightly different values, making snapshots useless for regression detection.\n\n**Current Problem:**\n- Snapshot tests fail randomly due to RNG variance\n- Regression tests need 1001×3 iterations and take 13 seconds\n- Tests are not reproducible across runs\n\n**After This Fix:**\n- Snapshot tests become deterministic and actually useful\n- Regression tests can use 100 iterations and run in \u003c1 second\n- All tests are reproducible: same seed = same results\n- CI becomes faster and more reliable\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\nThe simulation uses `rand::thread_rng()` in multiple modules:\n- `src/utilities.rs` - initiative rolls\n- `src/dice.rs` - dice rolling\n- `src/actions.rs` - attack rolls  \n- `src/action_resolver.rs` - various rolls\n- `src/resolution.rs` - saving throws\n\nAll of these need to be replaced with a seeded RNG that can be controlled from the API.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Add RNG Thread-Local Storage\nCreate a thread-local RNG that can be optionally seeded:\n\n```rust\n// src/rng.rs\nuse rand::prelude::*;\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\n\nthread_local! {\n    static RNG: RefCell\u003cOption\u003cStdRng\u003e\u003e = RefCell::new(None);\n}\n\npub fn seed_rng(seed: u64) {\n    RNG.with(|rng| {\n        *rng.borrow_mut() = Some(StdRng::seed_from_u64(seed));\n    });\n}\n\npub fn clear_rng() {\n    RNG.with(|rng| {\n        *rng.borrow_mut() = None;\n    });\n}\n\npub fn get_rng() -\u003e impl Rng {\n    RNG.with(|rng| {\n        match \u0026*rng.borrow() {\n            Some(seeded) =\u003e seeded.clone(),\n            None =\u003e {\n                // Fall back to thread_rng if no seed set\n                StdRng::from_entropy()\n            }\n        }\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Update Simulation API\nAdd optional `seed` parameter:\n\n```rust\n// src/lib.rs\npub fn run_event_driven_simulation_rust(\n    players: Vec\u003cCreature\u003e,\n    timeline: Vec\u003cTimelineStep\u003e,\n    iterations: usize,\n    log_enabled: bool,\n    seed: Option\u003cu64\u003e,  // ← NEW\n) -\u003e Vec\u003cSimulationRun\u003e {\n    if let Some(s) = seed {\n        rng::seed_rng(s);\n    }\n    \n    let mut all_runs = Vec::new();\n    for i in 0..iterations {\n        // Reset seed for each iteration for consistency\n        if let Some(s) = seed {\n            rng::seed_rng(s + i as u64);\n        }\n        \n        let (result, events) = run_single_event_driven_simulation(\u0026players, \u0026timeline, i == 0);\n        // ...\n    }\n    \n    if seed.is_some() {\n        rng::clear_rng();\n    }\n    \n    all_runs\n}\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Replace RNG Calls\nReplace `rand::thread_rng()` with `rng::get_rng()` in:\n- `src/utilities.rs` (roll_initiative)\n- `src/dice.rs` (roll_dice)\n- `src/actions.rs` (roll_with_advantage)\n- `src/action_resolver.rs` (resolve_attack, etc.)\n- `src/resolution.rs` (saving throws)\n\n### Phase 4: Update Tests to Use Fixed Seeds\nUpdate snapshot and regression tests to use deterministic seeds:\n\n```rust\n// tests/snapshot_tests.rs\nlet runs = run_event_driven_simulation_rust(\n    players, \n    timeline, \n    101, \n    false, \n    Some(42),  // ← Fixed seed for determinism\n);\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Optimize Regression Tests\nRemove the median-of-3 workaround since tests are now deterministic:\n\n```rust\n// Before: 1001 iterations × 3 runs = 3003 simulations\nlet iterations = 1001;\nfor _run in 0..3 {\n    let runs = run_event_driven_simulation_rust(...);\n    // collect and take median\n}\n\n// After: 100 iterations × 1 run = 100 simulations (30x faster!)\nlet runs = run_event_driven_simulation_rust(\n    players, timeline, 100, false, Some(42)\n);\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `src/lib.rs` - Add seed parameter to API\n- `src/rng.rs` - NEW: thread-local RNG storage\n- `src/utilities.rs` - Use seeded RNG\n- `src/dice.rs` - Use seeded RNG\n- `src/actions.rs` - Use seeded RNG\n- `src/action_resolver.rs` - Use seeded RNG\n- `src/resolution.rs` - Use seeded RNG\n- `tests/snapshot_tests.rs` - Use fixed seeds\n- `tests/regression_tests.rs` - Use fixed seeds, optimize iterations\n\n## Success Criteria\n- ✅ Snapshot tests pass consistently across multiple runs\n- ✅ Regression tests run in \u003c1 second (down from 13s)\n- ✅ All tests are reproducible (same seed produces same results)\n- ✅ Backward compatible: `None` seed uses random RNG (existing code unaffected)\n\n## Estimated Effort\n2-4 hours of focused work\n\n## Notes\n- Thread-local RNG ensures thread safety\n- Seed + iteration index ensures each run is deterministic but different\n- Clear RNG after simulation to avoid cross-contamination\n- Consider adding `--seed` CLI to sim_cli for debugging","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-28T00:24:40.049617+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-28T00:44:40.89406+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-28T00:44:40.89406+01:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
