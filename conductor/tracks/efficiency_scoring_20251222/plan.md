# Plan: Efficiency-Based Performance Scoring

## Phase 1: Foundation [checkpoint: 5792c28]
Goal: Prepare the model and aggregation logic for complex scoring.

- [x] Task: Update `SimulationResult` model (5792c28)
- [x] Task: Extend `calculate_score` logic (5792c28)

## Phase 2: Algorithm Implementation [checkpoint: 5792c28]
Goal: Implement the weighted resource penalty system.

- [x] Task: Implement Resource Penalty Calculation (5792c28)
- [x] Task: Integrate Scoring in Simulation Loop (5792c28)

## Phase 3: Integration & Verification [checkpoint: 5792c28]
Goal: Ensure the system sorts runs correctly by efficiency.

- [x] Task: Update Sorting Logic (5792c28)
- [x] Task: Verify Efficiency-Based Sorting (5792c28)
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification (5792c28)
