# Product Guidelines - BattleSim

## Prose Style & Tone
- **Minimalist & Direct:** Communication within the application and its documentation should be efficient and clear.
- **Data-Driven:** Prioritize technical accuracy and the presentation of information over decorative or flavor text.
- **Terminology:** Adhere strictly to 5e SRD terminology to ensure clarity for DMs and theorycrafters.

## Visual Identity
- **Modern & Clean:** The UI should follow Material Design principles, utilizing a clear visual hierarchy, consistent spacing, and readable typography.
- **Utility Over Ornament:** Avoid excessive medieval or parchment-style textures in favor of high-contrast, professional UI elements that enhance data readability.
- **Information Density:** Balance high information density with ample whitespace to prevent cognitive overload during complex encounter reviews.

## Brand Messaging
- **Utility First:** The primary brand value is the tool's effectiveness in solving balancing and strategy problems.
- **Tool as an Extension:** Position BattleSim as a reliable assistant that enhances the user's workflow rather than replacing their creativity.
